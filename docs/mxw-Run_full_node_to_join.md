A full node of Maxonrow Blockchain is a witness, which observes the consensus messaging, downloads blocks from data seed nodes.
Full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions from other nodes and then relaying them to the core Maxonrow network.

## Supported Platforms
We support running a full node on Mac OS X and Linux.

## Minimum System Requirements
The hardware must meet certain requirements to run a full node.
* Desktop or laptop hardware running recent versions of Mac OS X or Linux.
* 500 GB of free disk space, accessible at a minimum read/write speed of 100 MB/s.
* 4 cores of CPU and 8 gigabytes of memory (RAM).
* A broadband Internet connection with upload/download speeds of at least 1 megabyte per second
* Your full node has to run more hours in order to catch up with Maxonrow Blockchain. Run your node continuously for best results.
