The role of the handler is to define what action(s) needs to be taken when this `MsgTypeMintFungibleToken` message is received.

In the file (./x/token/fungible/handler.go) start with the following code:

NewHandler is essentially a sub-router that directs messages coming into this module to the proper handler.
Now, you need to define the actual logic for handling the MsgTypeMintFungibleToken message in `handleMsgMintFungibleToken`:

In this function, requirements need to be met before emitted by the network.

* A valid Token.
* Token which Mint Flag equals to true and must be approved, and not yet be freeze.
* Token can only be minted by token-creator.
* Token with Max-Supply bigger than ZERO is known as Fixed-Supply, which need do validate between Total-Supply and Max-Supply. Else is known as Dynamic-Supply.
* Action of Re-mint is allowed if not yet reached the total-supply-limit (as Fixed-Supply).
