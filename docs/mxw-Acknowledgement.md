# Acknowledgements
Maxonrow Blockchain has been through several iterations and evolutions, each time building upon work contributed by members of the blockchain community. We would like to acknowledge the outstanding work that we have been able to achieve during development.

### Tendermint and Cosmos
Our current implementation is built on forks of Tendermint and Cosmos SDK. We make use of a revised edition of Tendermint consensus and leverage its p2p networking logic, and Cosmos SDK features such as "bank" which is used for basic token transactions. Some of the changes have been contributed back to the projects.

With a foundation of clean, well-structured code from Cosmos SDK, we were able to build on a codebase that we saw as a better alternative. Many thanks to the Cosmos developers and its community for their work (and for being really helpful in our issues and pull requests!)
